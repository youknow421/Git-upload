# This is taken from the Buyforce-MVP file we were given.

BuyForce is a new digital commerce platform that leverages collective purchasing power to unlock wholesale-level pricing for consumers.
The platform focuses on high-value products (1,000+₪), enabling users to join group-buying campaigns with a symbolic 1₪  pre-authorization and charging the full discounted price only if the group reaches the minimum quantity required by suppliers.
If the group fails to reach the target - the pre-authorization is immediately refunded.
The platform launches with a Web App + Native iOS & Android apps, a complete Admin Console, and full Tranzilla payment integration.

# The MVP includes

• Dynamic homepage (Near Goal, Market-Breaking Deals, New Arrivals)
• Category browsing (electronics, travel, home, furniture, etc.)
• Wishlist
• My Groups
• Search overlay
• Fully designed product cards
• Admin portal with manual product & supplier operations
• Automated group lifecycle (open>locked >charged/refunded)

The system is fully scalable for future expansion into AI-driven supplier negotiation, international multi-currency commerce, and logistics partnerships.

# Current state
Project is fully done. Make sure to install the remaining dependancies with "pnpm install" before using "pnpm dev:all" to run the project.

I had to change the github page because the original project would refuse to get updated onto the site. 

It was a long project, but its finally over... for now i guess
